## Overview of Repository

This directory contains all the figures in the manuscript and supplementary text in addition to all the numerical values required to generate those figues. Following we elaborate in detail the where the data to generate each figure is located.

- `Figure1`: The diagram of the pipeline (does not have any numerical values).
- `Figure2/`: This figure has 6 subplots:
    -  Fig.2a: `Hepatocyte.tif`, `CD20_raw.tif`, and `CD20_FRmap.tif` are the images used in this subplot. The data regarding the two histograms in this subplot is given in `Histogram of CD20_inset_FRmap.csv` and `Histogram of CD20_inset_raw.csv`. 
    - Fig.2b: `Ki67_raw.tif`, and `Ki67_FRmap.tif` are the images used in this subplot. The data regarding the two histograms in this subplot is given in `Histogram of Ki67_inset_FRmap.csv` and `Histogram of Ki67_inset_raw.csv`. 
    - Fig.2c: `Pan-Keratin_raw.tif`, and `Pan-Keratin_FRmap.tif` are the images used in this subplot. The data regarding the two histograms in this subplot is given in `Histogram of Pan-Keratin_inset_FRmap.csv` and `Histogram of Pan-Keratin_inset_raw.csv`. 
    - Fig.2d: `CD163_raw.tif`, and `CD164_FRmap.tif` are the images used in this subplot. The data regarding the two histograms in this subplot is given in `histogramcell_A_raw.csv`, `histogramcell_B_raw.csv`, `histogramcell_C_raw.csv`, `histogramcell_A_FRmap.csv`, `histogramcell_B_FRmap.csv`, `histogramcell_C_FRmap.csv`. Moreover, the cell boundries are give in `RoiSet.zip`, and the signal measuremnts on both the raw image and the FRmap are given in the `aggregate_Cell_A_B_C_measurments.csv'.
